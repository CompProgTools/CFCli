# About CFCli

CF-Cli stands for Codeforces Command Line Interface is an extension of the Codeforces API accessibly right in your command line. I started this project as a part of Hack Club's YSWS (You Ship, We Ship) where you spend 12+ hours on a command line tool and get funding for electronics in return!!

I made a similar project in the past called [CP-Cli](https://compprogtools.github.io/CPCli), but its Codeforces integration was quite bad due to the software focusing on the bare minimum needed to speed up contest times and efficiency. CF-Cli aims to change that and focus on the Codeforces API in order to format data and display it nicely.
